## The Snowball Surprise

**Characters:**

* **Lily:** A little girl with bright, sparkling blue eyes and long, curly brown hair that she often wore in two pigtails. Her cheeks were rosy from the cold, and she had a small freckle on her nose. She wore a bright pink coat, a fluffy white hat, and mittens with snowflakes embroidered on them. 
* **Mr. Frosty:**  A friendly snowman with a carrot nose, two black button eyes, and a wide, cheerful smile. He wore a black top hat tilted slightly to one side and a scarf made of red and white stripes. His body was made of three large snowballs, perfectly round and smooth.

**Setting:**

A snowy backyard transformed into a winter wonderland. The grass was hidden under a blanket of white, and snow-covered trees stood tall and majestic. The air was crisp and clean, and snowflakes danced gracefully in the wind.  A wooden swing set stood in the corner, covered in a fluffy layer of snow. In the center of the yard, Mr. Frosty stood proudly, his smile radiating warmth.

**Story:**

Lily skipped excitedly through the snow, her boots crunching on the frosty ground. The winter wonderland was her favorite place to play. She loved the way the snow sparkled in the sunlight and the sound it made when she threw a snowball. 

Today, however, Lily had a special surprise for her friend, Mr. Frosty. She had spent the whole afternoon making him a beautiful red and white striped scarf, just like the one he wore.  

"Mr. Frosty!" she called, her voice echoing in the quiet air. "Look what I made for you!"

Mr. Frosty, who was busy building a snow fort, turned to see Lily approaching.  

"Oh, Lily!" he exclaimed, his button eyes twinkling. "That's the nicest scarf I've ever seen!"  

Lily carefully wrapped the scarf around Mr. Frosty's neck.  "I hope you like it," she said, her cheeks turning rosy with happiness. "It's just for you."

"It's perfect!" Mr. Frosty exclaimed, his smile wider than ever. "Thank you, Lily. You are the best friend a snowman could ask for."

Lily and Mr. Frosty spent the rest of the afternoon playing in the snow, building snow forts, and throwing snowballs.  They laughed and played until the sun began to set, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink.  

As the day came to an end, Lily knew she would have to go inside, but she couldn't leave without one last hug for her snowy friend.  

"I love you, Mr. Frosty," she whispered, giving him a big hug. 

"And I love you, Lily," Mr. Frosty replied, his voice muffled by the scarf. "See you tomorrow!"

Lily skipped home, her heart full of warmth and the memory of a perfect winter day with her best friend, Mr. Frosty.
