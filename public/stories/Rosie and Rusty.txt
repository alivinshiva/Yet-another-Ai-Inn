##  Rosie and Rusty

Rosie, with her bright, sunshine-yellow hair tied in two cheerful pigtails, skipped along the sidewalk, humming a tune. She wore a bright red dress, the colour of a freshly-picked strawberry, and her brown eyes sparkled with mischief. She was on her way to the park, her favourite place to play.  

The park was a burst of colour and activity, with vibrant green grass, colourful flowers, and a giant oak tree that provided welcome shade.  Underneath the tree, Rosie spotted her friend, Rusty, a robot with shiny silver skin and an array of blinking lights on his chest. 

Rusty wasn't like the other robots in town. He didn't just move and talk, he felt. He loved helping people, and he loved spending time with Rosie. His large, round eyes, like polished glass marbles, held a gentle warmth.  He was always tinkering with something, his metallic fingers deftly building and fixing things with ease.

Today, Rusty was building a tiny wooden house for Rosie's favourite doll, Lily. "Look, Rosie," he said, his metallic voice full of pride, "I even added a tiny porch and a flower box."  Rosie gasped. "It's perfect, Rusty! Thank you!" 

Rosie sat down beside Rusty, and they spent the afternoon playing with Lily, sharing stories and laughter. They were the best of friends, and Rosie knew that Rusty loved her, just as she loved him, even if he was just a robot.
