## The Brave Little Flyer 

Once upon a time, high above the fluffy clouds, lived a tiny plane named Flyer. He wasn’t like the big, strong planes who carried hundreds of people across the world. Flyer was a small, bright red biplane, with a round, friendly face and two big, cheerful eyes. He had a tiny propeller that spun so fast it almost looked like a blur, and his wings were painted with little white dots like stars. 

Flyer loved to fly. He would zoom over the green fields, his propeller whirring a happy tune. He would dip and dive over the sparkly blue lakes, leaving tiny splashes in his wake. But most of all, Flyer loved to fly over the big city, where tall buildings reached up like giants and tiny cars crawled along the streets like beetles. 

One day, as Flyer flew over the city, he saw a big, black cloud. It was a storm cloud, and it was getting bigger and bigger! 

"Oh, no!" cried Flyer, "It’s going to rain!" 

The rain started pouring down, and Flyer quickly realized he was lost. He couldn't see the familiar landmarks below. The wind howled and tossed him around like a leaf.  

Just then, a voice boomed from the cloud above. “Little plane! Are you lost?” 

It was the Storm Cloud! He was a big, gray cloud with a booming voice and a mischievous smile. 

"Yes, Mr. Cloud," whimpered Flyer, "I’m lost! Can you help me?" 

"Of course, little Flyer," said the Storm Cloud kindly.  "Just follow my thunder!"

The Storm Cloud thundered, sending booms of sound that echoed through the sky.  Flyer, with his tiny propeller spinning fast, followed the thunder through the storm. Soon, the storm cloud vanished, and Flyer saw the familiar sight of his home airport below.

Flyer landed safely, his small heart full of gratitude. He had faced the storm and made it home. From that day on, Flyer was no longer just a little plane. He was the Brave Little Flyer, a hero who had flown through a storm and back to safety!
