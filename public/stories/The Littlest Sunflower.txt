## The Littlest Sunflower

The sun peeked over the horizon, casting a golden glow on the sprawling garden. It was a symphony of color and scent, with roses in shades of pink and red, lavender swaying gently in the breeze, and vibrant lilies unfurling their petals. But nestled in the heart of this colorful paradise, a little sunflower named Sunny struggled to stand tall.

Sunny, unlike his towering siblings, was quite small. His stem was thin, his leaves delicate, and his golden head drooped slightly. He longed to reach for the sun like the other sunflowers, to bask in its warmth and proudly display his bright yellow face.

His best friend, Daisy, a cheerful daisy with petals as white as snow, often sat beside him.  Daisy, with her bright green stem and sunny yellow center, was a miniature ball of sunshine herself. "Don't worry, Sunny," she’d say, her voice a sweet whisper, "You’re just a little different. But that’s what makes you special."

One day, a mischievous breeze swept through the garden. It tugged at the petals of the lilies, ruffled the leaves of the roses, and sent the lavender swaying.  Sunny, caught in the wind's grip, swayed back and forth, fear gripping his heart.  His stem creaked and groaned, threatening to snap.

Daisy, noticing his distress, quickly reached out with her sturdy green stem and held on tight. "Hang on, Sunny!" she cried. "I won't let you go!"

Together, they weathered the storm, Daisy's strength anchoring Sunny, until the wind finally subsided. Sunny, though still small, felt a surge of courage. He wasn't like the other sunflowers, but he was strong in his own way. 

From that day on, Sunny stood a little taller, his head held high, his golden face beaming with the sun's warmth. He learned that even the smallest flower can shine brightly, with the help of a true friend.
